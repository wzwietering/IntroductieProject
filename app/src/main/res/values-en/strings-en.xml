    <string name="scenario_explanation_title">Explanation</string>
    <string name="scenario_freeplay">This is the free play mode. Here you can design your own ciruit.</string>
    <string name="scenario1_explanation">Connect the lamp with the battery, to give the lamp power. You can create a connection by pressing the wire icon, and then by tapping on the white dots of a component.</string>
    <string name="scenario2_explanation">Add a resistor to the circuit, so the light won\'t break. To add the resistor, you have to remove a wire. This can be done by touching a wire in wire mode. Run the circuit when you are done.</string>
    <string name="scenario3_explanation">Add a switch to the circuit, so you can flick the Lamp on and off. Afterwards press the switch to turn the lamp on.</string>
    <string name="scenario4_explanation">You now know how to build a circuit, time to try it out yourself! Make your own circuit with a lightbulbs and a way to turn the light off and on.</string>
    <string name="scenario5_explanation">A battery can do more than just turn a light on and off. Add a bell to your circuit!</string>
    <string name="scenario6_explanation">You can also make 2 circuits with 1 battery! Finish this circuit so the switch turns only one of the lamps on and off.</string>
    <string name="scenario7_explanation">Make 2 circuits with 1 battery by adding a lamp on one side and a switch on the other.</string>
    <string name="scenario_nonexisting">Unfortunately this scenario does not yet exist. You can create your own circuit here.</string>
    <string name="scenario_complete">Good job!</string>
    <string name="scenario_not_complete">The circuit is not right yet!</string>
    <string name="run">Run</string>
    <string name="scenario1_complete">Sadly, the lamp broke. In the next exercise you will learn how to keep the lamp working.</string>
    <string name="last_scenario_complete">Congratulations! You completed every exercise. Now, you can do whatever you want in free play mode!</string>
